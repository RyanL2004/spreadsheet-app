# Spreadsheet App

A **spreadsheet application** built using **functional programming principles**. This project was inspired by my personal need to organize and manage job applications more effectively. By developing a spreadsheet from scratch, I created a tool that meets my needs while honing my programming skills.

---

## Features

- **Custom Spreadsheet Logic**: Designed and implemented core spreadsheet functionalities, such as:
  - Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
  - Functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, and more
  - Range operations and duplicate removal
- **Dynamic Cell Updates**: Automatic recalculation of dependent cells when values are updated.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to support more functions and features.
- **Functional Programming**: Core logic written in a clean, declarative style for maintainability and scalability.

---

## Motivation

While applying for jobs, I often found it challenging to track the status of multiple applications and manage deadlines. Traditional tools like Excel and Google Sheets were effective but lacked the personal touch I wanted. Developing this project allowed me to:
- Customize a tool for my exact needs.
- Explore functional programming techniques in JavaScript.
- Build something practical and reusable for other scenarios.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Used to render the application and handle DOM interactions.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core spreadsheet logic written with functional programming principles.
- **HTML & CSS**: For the application structure and styling.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting the live version of the app.

## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RyanL2004/spreadsheet-app.git
   cd spreadsheet-app

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
